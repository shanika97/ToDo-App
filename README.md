# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# TODO-APP
- create a To-Do list web app (Task App) using react JS and tailwind CSS. This react ToDo app contains a input field, so that user can enter their task. Then the task will be added in the list.

- When user click on any task (or any to-do list) then it will be marked a completed or incomplete task. User can also delete the to-do items from the list using the delete icon (bin icon).

- This To-Do Task list will be saved in the browser, so that when we open the browser again we will find all our saved To-Do list / task list. To design this React App we will use Tailwind CSS.
